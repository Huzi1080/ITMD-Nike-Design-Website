Project Title: Nike Website Design

Name: Huzaifa Anis

Course: ITMD 362

Design Implementation: 

For this project, I designed a clean and modern product page inspired by Nike. 
My layout includes a large main product image in the center, a product image on the left, and product details on the right. 
Below the product title, I added pricing, a color selector, a size dropdown, an Add to Cart button, and a button to open the size chart modal.

The Page includes:
- Product Display Section
- Description of the Shoe
- Highlight/Footer Section

In addition, I used a simple visual style that includes round corners, clean spacing, and a light background.
Images and product details are displayed in a flexbox layout for responsiveness and better alignment.
Furthermore, I also designed a size chart using CSS, creating a clean and minimal look for users.

JavaScript Interactions: 

- Thumbnail Image Switcher
When the user clicks on a product image, the main product image changes to match that thumbnail image.
This is done by attaching a click event to each thumbnail.

- Add to Cart
When the user clicks “Add to Cart,” an alert message appears confirming the item was added to the cart.

- Size Chart 
The “Size Chart” button opens a small chart, allowing the user to view men’s and women’s sizes.

Challenges Faced:

Throughout the project, I encountered and solved several challenges involving layout, images, and JavaScript functionality.

- In the beginning, my images were not displaying correctly because they were stored in a separate folder.
The issue came from incorrect file paths, and I fixed it by reorganizing my folder structure and carefully checking each image.

- The size chart model is also a challenge I faced, especially making it open and close in a clean, smooth way.
I had to make sure the size chart closed properly when the user clicked outside the window or clicked the “X” button.

- Before the JavaScript worked correctly, the modal design itself looked too cluttered or oversized.
Therefore, I had to simplify the styling so that the content inside the model was easy to read and visually appealing.
